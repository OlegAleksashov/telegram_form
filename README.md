Project Description
This project is a web application designed to allow users to fill out a form and attach a photo, which is then sent to a Telegram chat. The entire program is developed using JavaScript (JS), TypeScript (TS), and React.

Key Features:
User-Friendly Form:

Users can easily fill out the required fields in the form.
The form is built with React, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.

Photo Attachment:

Users can attach a photo to their form submission.
The photo upload feature is integrated seamlessly with the form, allowing for easy attachment and preview before submission.

Telegram Integration:

Upon form submission, the data along with the attached photo is sent directly to a specified Telegram chat.
This integration ensures that the submitted information is promptly delivered and accessible in real-time.

Technology Stack:

JavaScript (JS): Core scripting language used for the overall functionality of the application.
TypeScript (TS): Utilized to add type definitions and enhance code reliability and maintainability.
React: Front-end library used to build the user interface, providing a dynamic and responsive experience.
Implementation Details:
Form Handling:

The form components are built using React, leveraging its state management to handle form data and photo uploads.
Validation is implemented to ensure that all required fields are filled out correctly before submission.

Photo Upload:

Users can select a photo from their device, which is then previewed within the form.
The photo is processed and prepared for submission along with the form data.

Sending Data to Telegram:

The application uses Telegram's Bot API to send the form data and photo to a specified chat.
A backend service handles the communication with Telegram, ensuring secure and efficient data transfer.
Error Handling:

Proper error handling mechanisms are in place to provide feedback to users in case of any issues during the form submission or photo upload process.
This project exemplifies the integration of modern web technologies to create a functional and user-friendly application that bridges user input and real-time communication via Telegram.
